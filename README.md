## Streamline part export to slicer directly within SolidWorks using a macro

This repository provides a macro or automation script that streamlines exporting SolidWorks parts directly to the slicer. It simplifies the workflow by:

*  Automatically copying the selected part file.
*  Converting the file format to a format readable by the slicer.
*  Launching the slicer and importing the converted file.
  
This eliminates the need for manual file conversion and import, saving you time and effort.
